4.4 – Change in Temperature Application
The rate of change in the temperature of an object, 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 , is directly proportional to the difference between its
temperature, T, and the ambient temperature, T 0.
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 𝑘𝑘(𝑑𝑑0 − 𝑑𝑑)
Given a constant of proportionality, k, of 0.1 s -1 and an ambient temperature of 20 ̊C, graph the temperature of the
object over the first 50 seconds for each of the following initial temperatures (all on the same graph):
• 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 ̊C
